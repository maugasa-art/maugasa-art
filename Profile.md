## **Hello, I am Sam**

I am a year 11 student currently taking digital technology as a subject. I am not very good at coding, in fact I have never coded in my life, and the closest experience I have to coding was changing my personal settings and sensitivity on my *Overwatch 2* account. I wanted to study digital technology because I thought it would be cool to finally learn some coding, and I always wanted to learn how to make a platform based fighter game, *except I don't know how to code at all.* The most I know is that spaces are replaced with dashes. I really like hip hop, soul/RNB and indie pop. Some of my favourite artist are:
+ Tyler, the Creator
+ MF DOOM
+ J. Cole
+ Earl Sweatshirt
+ Mac Miller
+ Malcolm Todd
+ Kanye West (not new Kanye)
